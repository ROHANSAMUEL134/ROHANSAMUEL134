Hello all, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Zoho, where I recently built a customer churn prediction system using a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines BiLSTM, CNN, and attention mechanisms. My current focus is on applied research in large language models (LLMs), particularly exploring prompt engineering, fine-tuning strategies, and integrating transformer-based models into production pipelines for real-world NLP tasks.
